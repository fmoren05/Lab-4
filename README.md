In this experiment, we implemented a real-time scheduler to enable multitasking and control two motors simultaneously. We evaluated the control system's performance by adjusting task timing and analyzing step response plots. When one motor control task was run too slowly, noticeable degradation occurred. Based on these observations, we recommend a specific speed for proper operation. Overall, the two-motor control system demonstrated effective performance within the recommended task run rate, ensuring smooth operation of the motors.
